# CoreHook

A library to intercept function calls in applications and extend their functionality with managed code by [hosting](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/docs/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting.md) the .NET Core runtime inside applications on various architectures running [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x), [macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/macos-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x), and [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x).

Inspired and based on the great [EasyHook](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook).

## Examples

 * [FileMonitor - Linux and macOS (Unix)](examples/Unix/CoreHook.Unix.FileMonitor/)
 * [FileMonitor - Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](examples/UWP/CoreHook.UWP.FileMonitor/) 
 * [FileMonitor - Windows Desktop Applications (Win32)](examples/Win32/CoreHook.FileMonitor)

## Usage

### Windows

First, set the environment variables for the `x86` and `x64` applications to the installation folder of your desired dotnet runtime. 

Using the `.NET Core 2.1` runtime as an example (validate the paths if you have another installation directory or drive):

 * Set `CORE_LIBRARIES_32` and `CORE_ROOT_32` to `C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.4` for `32-bit(x86)` applications.
 
 * Set `CORE_LIBRARIES_64` and `CORE_ROOT_64` to `C:\Program Files\dotnet\shared\Microsoft.NETCore.App\2.1.4` for `64-bit(x64)` applications.


Then open the `CoreHook` solution `(.sln file)` in Visual Studio and you can build the examples, either `CoreHook.FileMonitor` or `CoreHook.UWP.FileMonitor`.

Finally, build or download the binary releases (in ZIP files) from [CoreHook.Hooking](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook.Hooking) and [CoreHook.Host](https://github.com/unknownv2/CoreHook.Host). Place the `corerundll32.dll (X86, ARM)` and/or `corerundll64.dll (X64, ARM64)` binaries in the output directory of your program. Then, place the `corehook32.dll (X86, ARM)` and/or `corehook64.dll (X64, ARM64)` binaries in the same output directory. These are all of the required files for using the examples above. 

You can then start the program you built above.

### Windows 10 IoT Core (ARM32)
**There is currently no ARM32 SDK for .NET Core, so you must publish the application and copy it to your device. [You can read more about the publishing process here.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/samples/RaspberryPiInstructions.md)**

For `Windows 10 IoT Core`, you can publish the application by running the `publish.ps1` [PowerShell script](#publishing-script).

```
.\publish -example win32 -runtime win-arm
```

Make sure to also copy the `corerundll32.dll` and the `corehook32.dll` to the directory of the program. For example, the application directory structure should look like this:

```
[+]Publish\win32\win-arm\
    [+]Hook\
        ...
        [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.Hook.deps.json
        [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.Hook.dll
        ...
    ...    
    [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.dll
    [-] CoreHook.FileMonitor.exe
    [-] corehook32.dll
    [-] corerundll32.dll
    ...
```


You can then copy the folder to your device and start the `CoreHook.FileMonitor.exe` program.

### Publishing Script

The PowerShell script `publish.ps1` allows you to publish the [examples](/examples) as self-contained executables. The default configuration is `Release` and the output will be in the `Publish` directory, created in the same location as the publishing script.

```
.\publish -example [unix|uwp|win32] -runtime [Runtime IDentifier] -configuration [Debug|Release]
```

**You can find a list of Runtime IDentifiers [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)**.

For example, the command

```
.\publish -example win32 -runtime win10-arm
```

will create a folder called `Publish/win32/win10-arm/` containing the `CoreHook.FileMonitor` example.

```
.\publish -example uwp -runtime win10-arm64
```
will create a folder called `Publish/uwp/win10-arm64/` containing the `CoreHook.UWP.FileMonitor` example.


### Windows Symbol Support

CoreHook supports symbol name lookup from PDBs to get function addresses with the use of `LocalHook.GetProcAddress`. For symbol lookup to work, you must either place the PDB file in the directory of the target program you are hooking or set the environment variable `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` to a symbol server. [You can read more about Windows symbol support from the Microsoft documentation here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dxtecharts/debugging-with-symbols#using-the-microsoft-symbol-server)

**Important:** To use the complete symbol lookup, you need to have both `dbghelp.dll` (provides the symbol lookup APIs) and `symsrv.dll` (provides the symbol server lookup) and in your [DLL search path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order). You can add these files to the directory of your target program or add them to your path. You can get both DLLs by installing the [***Debugging Tools for Windows***](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/).

Example locations where you can find `symsrv.dll` and `dbghelp.dll` are:

* *C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x86* (For 32-bit applications)
* *C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64* (For 64-bit applications)


An example of what you can set the environment variable `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` to is:

```
srv*C:\SymbolCache*https://msdl.microsoft.com/downloads/symbols
```

The `C:\SymbolCache` folder is a local cache directory where symbol files can be stored or downloaded to. When Windows needs to retrieve a PDB for a DLL, it can download them from `https://msdl.microsoft.com/downloads/symbols` and store them in a folder for use by a debugger.

You can test symbol support by running the `DetourInternalFunction{XX}` [tests](test/CoreHook.Tests/LocalHookTests.Windows.cs).

### Notes on Windows UWP Usage

 There is currently no way to set the proper access control on our pipes on the .NET Core platform and the issue is [being tracked here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/31190) so we use P/Invoke to call `kernel32.dll!CreateNamedPipe` directly.
